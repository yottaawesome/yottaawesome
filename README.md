## ðŸ‘‹ A little about me...

I'm an Australian software engineer with a restless mind and close to fifteen years of experience in the software industry. Over the years, I've either worked on, played with, or developed an interest in everything from low-level C++ and Win32 system programming, to front-end development with HTML and JavaScript, to server-side development with .NET and C#, to game development with Unity and Unreal engines, to machine learning with Python.
